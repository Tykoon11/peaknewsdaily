## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Basic Application

Here's a practical example of how to implement these concepts:

\`\`\`
Example Calculation:
Account Balance: $10,000
Risk Per Trade: 2%
Risk Amount = $10,000 ร 0.02 = $200

If Stop Loss Distance = $2 per share
Position Size = $200 รท $2 = 100 shares
\`\`\`

**Key Points:**
- Always calculate position size based on risk amount

- Adjust for market volatility and liquidity

### Example 2: Advanced Strategy

A more sophisticated approach for experienced traders:

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Risk Management Errors
- **Over-leveraging**: Using too much leverage relative to account size
- **Inadequate stop losses**: Not setting proper exit points before entering trades
- **Position sizing mistakes**: Risking too much or too little on individual trades
- **Ignoring correlation**: Taking multiple highly correlated positions

### 2. Psychological Pitfalls
- **Emotional decision making**: Letting fear and greed override logical analysis
- **Revenge trading**: Trying to quickly recover from losses with bigger risks
- **Overconfidence**: Taking excessive risks after a winning streak
- **Analysis paralysis**: Over-analyzing instead of taking action

### 3. Execution Issues
- **Poor timing**: Entering or exiting trades at suboptimal times
- **Platform problems**: Not understanding your trading platform fully
- **Slippage ignorance**: Not accounting for execution costs and slippage

- Use appropriate stop loss techniques for different market conditions
- Consider using trailing stops to protect profits
