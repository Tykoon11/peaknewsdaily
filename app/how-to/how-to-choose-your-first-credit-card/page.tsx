        <h2>Decide What You Value: Cash Back, Travel, or Building Credit</h2>
        <p>Your first card should match your primary goal:</p>
        <h3>If Your Goal is Building Credit</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Focus on:</strong> No annual fee, autopay, educational resources</li>
          <li><strong>Rewards matter less:</strong> Simple 1% cash back is fine</li>
          <li><strong>Best options:</strong> Secured cards from major issuers, basic student cards</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>If You Want Simple Cash Back</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Look for:</strong> Flat-rate cards (1.5-2% on everything) or simple bonus categories</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid:</strong> Complex category rotations, spending caps you can't hit</li>
          <li><strong>Best options:</strong> Discover it Student, Capital One QuicksilverOne</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>If You're Interested in Travel</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Start simple:</strong> General travel cards, not airline-specific</li>
          <li><strong>Look for:</strong> No foreign transaction fees, travel protections</li>
          <li><strong>Best options:</strong> Student travel cards, basic travel rewards cards</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Compare Total Cost: Annual Fee, APR, Foreign Fees, Penalties</h2>
        <p>The cheapest card isn't always the best, but avoid unnecessary costs as a beginner:</p>
        <div className="overflow-x-auto">

            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>
        <h3>Why APR Usually Doesn't Matter</h3>
        <p>If you pay your full statement balance every month (which you should), you'll never pay interest. Focus on fees and features instead of APR for your first card.</p>
        <h2>Approval Odds: Issuer Rules, Income, and Existing Banking Relationships</h2>
        <p>Understanding approval factors helps you apply strategically:</p>
        <h3>Income Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>List household income if under 21:</strong> Include parents' income you have reasonable access to</li>
          <li><strong>Count all income sources:</strong> Jobs, financial aid, allowances, investment income</li>
          <li><strong>Be honest but inclusive:</strong> Don't lowball, but don't exaggerate</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Existing Banking Relationships</h3>
        <p>Your current bank often offers easier approval:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Banks see your account history:</strong> Consistent deposits and responsible use help</li>
          <li><strong>Ask about pre-approved offers:</strong> Check online banking or call</li>
          <li><strong>Consider branch visit:</strong> Relationship bankers can sometimes help with applications</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Issuer-Specific Rules</h3>
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">
          <h4 className="font-semibold mb-4">Major Issuer Approval Patterns</h4>
          <div className="space-y-3 text-sm">
            <p><strong>Discover:</strong> Very beginner-friendly, often approves thin credit files</p>
            <p><strong>Capital One:</strong> Uses own underwriting model, prequalification accurate</p>
            <p><strong>Chase:</strong> Typically wants 1+ year credit history, higher income requirements</p>
            <p><strong>Citi:</strong> Moderate requirements, good for fair credit</p>
            <p><strong>American Express:</strong> Higher standards, but some beginner-friendly options</p>

        <h2>How to Apply Responsibly & What to Do if Declined</h2>
        <h3>Before You Apply</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Check prequalification first:</strong> Soft pull won't hurt score</li>
          <li><strong>Apply when your profile is strongest:</strong> Recent pay stub, low existing utilization</li>
          <li><strong>Have information ready:</strong> SSN, income, housing costs, employer info</li>
          <li><strong>Apply for one card at a time:</strong> Multiple applications in short period hurt approval odds</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Application Best Practices</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Apply online:</strong> Usually faster than phone or mail</li>
          <li><strong>Be honest and accurate:</strong> Lying can lead to account closure later</li>
          <li><strong>Apply during business hours:</strong> If you need to call for reconsideration</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>If You're Declined</h3>

            <li>4. <strong>Wait before reapplying:</strong> 3-6 months minimum, preferably after improvement</li>
            <li>5. <strong>Consider secured card:</strong> Easier approval while building credit</li>

        <h2>First 90-Day Playbook: Utilization, Payments, and Score Growth</h2>
        <p>Your first three months set the foundation for long-term credit success:</p>
        <h3>Week 1: Set Up Your Account</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Activate your card:</strong> Call the number or use mobile app</li>
          <li><strong>Set up online account:</strong> Register for web/mobile access</li>
          <li><strong>Enable autopay:</strong> Full statement balance, 5-7 days before due date</li>
          <li><strong>Set up alerts:</strong> Large purchases, payment due, payment posted</li>
          <li><strong>Learn your statement cycle:</strong> When it closes, when payment is due</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Month 1: Start Using Responsibly</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Make small purchases:</strong> Gas, groceries, subscriptions you already pay</li>
          <li><strong>Keep utilization under 30%:</strong> If limit is $500, keep balance under $150</li>
          <li><strong>Pay off weekly:</strong> Don't wait for statement to pay balance down</li>
          <li><strong>Track spending:</strong> Make sure you can pay full statement balance</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Month 2-3: Build Positive History</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Gradually increase usage:</strong> Show regular, responsible use</li>
          <li><strong>Aim for under 10% utilization:</strong> Best for credit score growth</li>
          <li><strong>Never miss a payment:</strong> Payment history is 35% of your score</li>
          <li><strong>Monitor your credit score:</strong> Should start improving after 2-3 months</li>

            For fastest score growth, keep utilization around 1-9% when your statement closes. This shows you use the card but manage debt well. Pay most of your balance before the statement closes, leaving just a small amount.

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Is a secured card better than a beginner cash-back card?</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              Secured cards are best if you have thin or no credit history and can't qualify for unsecured cards. If you can prequalify for beginner unsecured cards, those are typically better since they don't require a deposit and often have better rewards.

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Will applying hurt my credit score?</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              A single hard inquiry may drop your score a few points temporarily (usually 5-10 points for 3-6 months). This is normal and the score typically rebounds with on-time payments and responsible use.

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">What credit limit should I aim for?</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              For your first card, aim for enough limit to keep utilization under 30% of your normal spending. If you spend $300/month on the card, a $1,000+ limit lets you stay under 30% utilization easily.

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Should I get a store card as my first credit card?</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              Generally no. Store cards often have higher interest rates, lower limits, and limited usefulness. A general-use card from a major issuer will be more beneficial for building credit and daily use.
