              Freelancers pay both employee and employer portions of Social Security and Medicare 
              taxes (15.3% total) PLUS income tax. If you earn $50,000, expect to owe $10,000-15,000 
              in taxes. Start saving 25-30% of every payment immediately.

          <h3>1. Understanding Your True Tax Rate</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Freelancers face a unique tax burden.</strong> Unlike employees who split 
            payroll taxes with their employer, you pay the full 15.3% self-employment tax 
            plus regular income tax rates.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Automated Tax Savings System</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>Remove willpower from the equation.</strong> Set up automatic systems 
            that save taxes before you can spend the money. Manual saving fails when 
            cash flow gets tight.
          </p>

          <h4>The Three-Account Strategy:</h4>

                <p className="text-blue-700">All client payments go here first. Set up automatic transfers to tax and personal accounts.</p>
              </div>
              
              <div>
                <strong className="text-blue-800">Tax Savings Account (High-Yield):</strong>
                <p className="text-blue-700">30% of net income automatically transfers here. Never touch this money except for tax payments.</p>
              </div>

                <strong className="text-blue-800">Personal Account (Your Salary):</strong>

          <h4>Recommended High-Yield Tax Savings Accounts:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Marcus by Goldman Sachs:</strong> 4.5%+ APY, no minimum balance</li>

          </ul>

          <h3>3. Quarterly Estimated Tax Payments</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>The IRS requires quarterly payments if you'll owe $1,000+ in taxes.</strong> 
            Missing payments results in penalties, even if you pay the full amount by April 15th.
          </p>

          <h4>Calculating Quarterly Payments:</h4>
          <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-6">
            <h5 className="font-semibold mb-2">Method 1: Safe Harbor Rule</h5>
            <p className="text-sm mb-4">
              Pay 100% of last year's tax liability (110% if AGI &gt; $150,000) divided by 4 quarters. 
              No penalties even if you owe more.

            <p className="text-sm">
              Estimate current year taxes, subtract withholdings, divide by remaining quarters. 
              More accurate but requires good record-keeping.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>4. Business Expense Optimization</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>Every legitimate business expense reduces your taxable income dollar-for-dollar.</strong> 
            A $1,000 expense saves you $300-400 in taxes, depending on your tax bracket.

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">What happens if I don't make quarterly tax payments?</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                The IRS charges underpayment penalties of about 8% annually on the unpaid amount. 
                Even if you pay the full amount by April 15th, you'll still owe penalties for 
                not paying quarterly if you owe over $1,000.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Can I change my quarterly payment amounts during the year?</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Yes, you can adjust quarterly payments based on actual income. If your income is 
                lower than expected, you can reduce future payments. If higher, increase them to 
                avoid underpayment penalties.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Should I choose traditional or Roth IRA contributions?</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Traditional IRA/401(k) contributions reduce current taxes, while Roth contributions 
                are made with after-tax dollars but grow tax-free. If you're in a high tax bracket 
                now, traditional contributions often make more sense.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">How much should I save for state taxes?</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                This varies by state. No-income-tax states (Texas, Florida, Tennessee, etc.) 
                require no additional savings. High-tax states like California or New York may 
                require an additional 5-10% savings rate.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">What records should I keep for tax purposes?</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Keep all business receipts, bank statements, 1099 forms, mileage logs, and 
                home office documentation for at least 3 years (7 years if you significantly 
                underreport income). Digital copies stored in cloud services are acceptable.
