              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">How long does it take to get clients through organic methods?</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Organic methods typically take 3-6 months to gain momentum, but the timeline varies 
                by industry and consistency of effort. Start seeing some results within 30-60 days 
                of consistent networking and content creation, with compound growth over time.

              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Which organic method generates clients fastest?</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Direct outreach to warm connections and strategic networking typically generate 
                clients fastest. Content marketing and SEO take longer but provide more sustainable, 
                long-term results. Most successful businesses use a combination of both approaches.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Should I focus on one platform or be everywhere?</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Start with one platform where your ideal clients spend time and do it well before 
                expanding. It's better to have a strong presence on one platform than a weak 
                presence on multiple platforms. LinkedIn works well for B2B, Instagram for visual services.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Ask for referrals after delivering great results when client satisfaction is highest. 
                Be specific about who you're looking for and make it easy by providing language or 
                templates they can use. Frame it as helping others, not just helping yourself.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Focus on helping others rather than promoting yourself. Share useful information, 
                make introductions, and solve problems publicly. This builds your reputation naturally. 
                Start online where it feels less intimidating, then gradually move to in-person networking.
